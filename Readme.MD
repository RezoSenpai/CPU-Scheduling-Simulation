## Hello

I created these for an assessment. Feel free to use these as reference if you have to do it too.

DO NOT JUST CLONE IT!!

As mentioned, it's only for reference. 


The round robin scheduling file is commented the most. Read that if you don't understand what each line does.

FIFO = First in First Out

SJF = Shortest Job First

PRI = Priority

RR = Round Robin
